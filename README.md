# LetsGetDrinks

LetsGetDrinks is an iOS app with a simple interface that let's you quickly find bars nearby and request an Uber ride for them.

Once you open the app, it will ask for permission to use your location while the app is running, and once the location is loaded it will zoom in to your region and show nearby venues on the map using Google Places Search API.

Selecting a venue allows you to see its information in an overlay view with options of adding it to your favorites for future offline access and requesting an uber ride to the address, using Uber API.

The app provides map and collection views for scrolling through venues. Clicking the start icon at the top allows you to toggle between regular and favorites mode, which will only show venues which have previously been starred.
